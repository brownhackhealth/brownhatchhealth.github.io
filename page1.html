Our team aims to increase minority access to healthcare resources by connecting individuals with culturally-competent healthcare providers. We see cultural competency as something greater than just a spoken language: it encompasses an individual’s personal, socioeconomic, and cultural experiences. We envision our solution as an online platform for certifying physician practices as culturally-competent and for helping minority patients find a doctor that they can identify with so that they can receive the highest quality care possible. We are currently working with the Hispanic population of Rhode Island to evaluate what factors they value most in establishing a mutually beneficial relationship with their doctors.&nbsp;<br></p>

With a shift towards value-based care over traditional fee-for-service, there is hope that the growth rate for medical expenditures will diminish. Of course, novel technology will continue to be developed due to financial incentives, which will add to overall healthcare costs. The interests of patients must remain the focus of healthcare, and the rising prevalence of preventive and holistic medicine will help with the general population health. Unless major reforms in education or payment systems occur, healthcare is likely to still be dominated by specialty medicine rather than primary care, which will also continue to contribute to high expenditures."</p>

While the United States spends the most on healthcare per capita, we also have the highest burden of chronic disease and poor population health outcomes. The fragmented nature of healthcare is not sustainable, especially considering the rising average population age. Stakeholders will be forced to wake up to the massive amount of waste produced. In addition, the inefficiencies present within systems such as organ donations and electronic health records will have to be fixed. Value-based care will become a standard in the industry to reduce costs and align incentives. Overall, the healthcare changes will be geared towards increasing efficiencies and reducing costs without diminishing quality of care, whether that occurs through market consolidation or a public payer system."</p>

I believe that technology will play a large role in not only facilitating these changes but also helping to advance the treatment of such diseases.

Choosing a healthcare provider or insurance plan should not be any more difficult than any other aspect of your life, and I think this can only be done by changing how care is given. Eventually, I think that getting access to a provider should be as convenient as getting takeout, and the care received should run on a value-based, patient- centered approach. There are many innovations currently taking place towards this, including in telehealth tools and 24/7 concierge services, and I think that the healthcare landscape will change dramatically for the better."</p>
